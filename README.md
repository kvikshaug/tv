# tv

tv is a lightweight CLI application that helps you keep an overview of your favorite TV series.

By utilizing the exhaustive TV series database at [thetvdb.com](https://www.thetvdb.com/), the client lets you manage and categorize a list of your favorite tv series, keep track of which episodes you've seen, and see when the next episode is airing.

Note that tv does not read or handle files or directories, or integrate with any media center. Rather, it is a standalone application to compliment your existing media experience.

## Getting started

Install the package from pypi:

```
$ pip install tv-series
```

Run `init` to initialize the application. You will be asked for an API key which you can generate on [thetvdb.com](https://www.thetvdb.com/).

```
$ tv init
```

To add your first series, first use `search` to find your series by its name.

```
$ tv search dexter
79349: Dexter (Ended)
  Dexter Morgan is a Miami-based blood splatter expert who doesn't just solve murders; he commits them too. In fact, he's a serial killer -- but he only murders the guilty, so he feels justified with his lifestyle choices. His policewoman sister and his cop co-workers have no idea Dexter lives a double life; however, adoptive father Harry knows his secret, and does, in fact, help Dexter hone his "skills." It's a unique brand of justice for which charming Dexter feels a psychological hunger.

  Animated web series providing background and depth to Dexter's character and relationships.
```

Use the numeric ID to `add` the series you were looking for.

```
$ tv add 79349
Looking up series by id 79349
Added series Dexter with default category default
```

Now you can see your series using `list`. It shows that there are 96 episodes available to watch.

```
$ tv list -c default
  TVDB ID  Series    Last seen    Available          Next on air    Status
---------  --------  -----------  -----------------  -------------  --------
    79349  Dexter                 S01E01 (96 total)  -              Ended
```

Let's show a different example. Below, you can see that:

* You've seen the first season of The Orville, but there is one more season available with 14 episodes
* You've seen all of Fool Us, but the next episode will be available June 24th
* You've finished The Wire and there will be no more episodes

```
$ tv list -a
  TVDB ID  Series                   Last seen    Available            Next on air          Status
---------  -----------------------  -----------  -------------------  -------------------  ----------
   328487  The Orville              S01E12       S02E01 (14 total)    -                    Continuing
   239851  Penn & Teller: Fool Us   S06E01       -                    S06E02 (2019-06-24)  Continuing
    79126  The Wire                 S05E10       -                    -                    Ended
